## User stories

## UX Design
### Wireframes

![Desktop wireframe](./assets/readme-assets/desktop-wf.PNG)

For design I began with my wireframes, starting with mobile and allocating space to each section while determining how I'd like to lay it out. I then worked my way up to ensure that appropriate space was taken up by each section as the website expanded onto larger devices.

### Colours and fonts
![Colour scheme](./assets/readme-assets/colour-scheme.PNG)

I began with looking for colours that would suit my website using the site 'coolors'. I experimented with a couple and ultimately landed on the selection shown above. I felt these were accessible and combined well. In the final product I ensured these were added as variable elements at the beginning of my css document so that during testing if issues arose I could easily swap the colours around without having to manually change every instance of the colour.

In the website I selected two fonts, mostly to allow headings to stand out. I ended selecting 'Roboto Flex' and 'Poiret One' from google fonts, as I felt they were easy enough to read, both being a Sans Serif font, whilst also different enough to allow for variation on my page.

## Features

1. A navbar allowing for quick movement to any element on the page
2. A header section containing a background image, title, subtitle, and introductory segment.
3. A section containing cards which contain information
4. A section containing a list
5. A section containing cards comprised of buttons that link to external websites and small amounts of text
6. A footer

## Deployment

The website has been deployed through Github Pages. It requires no additional applications to be ran.

## Reflections

Upon setting out upon producing my website I felt that the wireframes indicated an adequate level of content to be included. Upon reflection, I feel like cards were a poor choice to lay out my information section, limiting the content of the page and leaving room to be desired. If I were to create a website similar to this again I would likely create further sections within the information section to allow for greater, and more engaging content to be included.

The list items stretch out too far leaving a lot of empty space on larger devices. If I had the time I would've liked to add an image here to break up the content on empty space, this would've also broken up content on smaller devices for better reading even with the image below the list.
